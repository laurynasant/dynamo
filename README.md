## Dynamo

Dynamo is a simple iOS and Watch OS app that allows following exercise routines. It is built using SwiftUI with a shared data model and WatchConnectivity to sync main actions when using the app during the exercises. The training schedule is built in statically, based on the training routine by Bruce Lee :heart:
